## Safescroll
The objective of our SafeScroll project is to leverage AI to detect and flag unsuitable content on short video platforms (i.e., TikTok, YouTube Shorts) to ensure online safety for children.
Our dataset consists of 2255 videos, and their associated titles: 1353 from TikTok and 902 from YouTube Shorts.

 ### Tool we've used   
for scrapping the data:
 - TikApi
 - Apify
##
For extracting the data from the images:
- IncptionV3
- RNN

we've tried the pre-trained models: IncptionV3, ResNet50, and Vit 

but got the highest accuracy with IncptionV3
